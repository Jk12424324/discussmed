This is a short blog that just details our transition in terms of the website. For the past year, our website was www.medicalseeds.weebly.com, but we have since transitioned to a more professional, customizable website-- discussmed.org. We are excited as a team and organization for the transition in website and are optimistic about the impact that we can make in the future. Thanks for understanding and helping us achieve our mission!
From,
Discussmed team
