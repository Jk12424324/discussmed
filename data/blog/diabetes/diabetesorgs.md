Diabetes is one of the most common hormonal disorders in the world, with many not even being aware they might have the disease. In order to be aware and support those suffering from diabetes, it's important to be educated on the topic. This blog highlights three organizations that help educate individuals on diabetes.

The CDC provides programs that educate people on the management of diabetes and how to lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. In specific, it funds groups that strive to enhance the health outcomes of people with diabetes. Their national funding for 2022 added up to $88.5 million.

The Diabetes Advocacy Alliance advocates for advancing healthcare policies related to diabetes. Their aim is also to educate about the correlation between obesity and diabetes. The areas they're focused on from a legislative approach include the prevention of diabetes, undiagnosed type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes, and supplying care for those diagnosed with diabetes. It also supports the funding of other organizations that fight for the prevention and awareness of diabetes, addresses social determinants of health, and advocates for coverage of Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) for people with prediabetes and obesity along with other factors aimed to fight against diabetes.
