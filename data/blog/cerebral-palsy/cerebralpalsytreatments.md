summary: 'This blog post deviates from our usual post on treatments as we provide an overview of current methods to treat cerebral palsy rather than focusing on a specific method of treatment. This is an ideal post to understand in a simple yet comprehensive manner the common ways to treat and alleviate the effects of cerebral palsy.'

As of right now, there is no known cure for cerebral palsy. However, there are many treatments to improve the individual's daily functioning. Physical therapy is a very important factor in helping a child's muscle strength, balance, and movement; it helps to teach skills such as walking and sitting. Other forms of therapy that are beneficial for cerebral palsy include: occupational therapy (allows the child to learn how to do everyday tasks independently), speech and language therapy (improves verbal speech skills or focuses on teaching sign language), and recreational therapy (specialized sports for children that benefits mobility and emotional health). 

  

Other ways to improve difficulties caused by cerebral palsy are to take medications and use specialized devices based on the individual's needs. Specific medicines (such as Botox) are designed to help prevent abnormal movements and general stiffness. It is also commonly recommended for a child to take muscle relaxants orally that also help mitigate stiffness. Assistance by equipment such as crutches, wheelchairs, specialized communication devices, and braces and casts for impaired limbs are also often used. 

In extreme cases, surgery is recommended. A common type of orthopedic surgery used to combat cerebral palsy lengthens or repositions muscles and tendons that have been compressed by contractures. Muscles often develop contractures in spastic cerebral palsy where there is a limited joint range of motion and muscles are functionally short. This procedure effectively reduces discomfort while increasing mobility.  Another option for surgery is known as a selective dorsal rhizotomy. In this particular surgery, surgeons may cut the nerves supplying particular spastic muscles. This relieves pain by relaxing the muscles in the legs but contains the potential risk of numbness.
