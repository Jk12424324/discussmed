This blog features three organizations that strive to better the lives of people with cerebral palsy.

-   Millions of dollars are donated annually by this organization toward studying cerebral palsy. Funding the study of cerebral palsy includes things like research and clinical tests of modern therapies intended to improve patients' mobility and overall quality of life.

-   The Cerebral Palsy Foundation also works to boost federal funding for people with cerebral palsy in addition to sponsoring research. It also takes the initiative in promoting better training for medical professionals like doctors, nurses, and therapists.

-   This organization was one of the first charities to develop affiliate networks across the country and internationally. Currently, there are over 100 affiliates that regularly assist families in locating services and initiatives in their local regions. Almost all affiliates provide educational services, assistance with finding employment, housing, psychiatric support, family support networks, transportation assistance, and leisure activities for those with or affected by cerebral palsy.
     

-   The Americans with Disabilities Act, also known as the ADA, was enacted in 1990 with United Cerebral Palsy playing a critical component in its passing. The ADA gave people with physical, mental, or developmental disabilities substantial civil rights protections.
    

[Cerebral Palsy Research Network](https://cprn.org/)

-   The Cerebral Palsy Research Network is a partnership between community members and hospitals that are brought together by their common interest in improving the health outcomes for cerebral palsy patients. This network intends to do this by conducting trailblazing research, educating the public, and offering community programs.    

-   This network consists of a specialized online community where users may learn about evidence-based treatment alternatives and research priorities, share their own life experiences, and connect with others.
